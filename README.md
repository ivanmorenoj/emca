# EMCA 
## Air quality monitoring system
![](https://github.com/ivanmorenoj/emca/workflows/check-build/badge.svg)

***This program was developed by Ivan Moreno as part of his thesis project.***
The projet get the gas concentration of alphasense (CO,NO2,SO2) and aeroqual (O3), process and save in mariadb database and finally send these values over a LoRaWAN Network.

## Required hardware
 - Raspberry pi
 - BME280 sensor
 - Catwan USB Stick from electronic cats
 - Alphasense type B4 gas sensors (CO,NO2,SO2)
 - Aeroqual SM50 (O3)
 - ADC Differential MCP3424 module from ABE Electronics
 - Signal conditioner
 - DC - DC step down
 - 12V 24W power suply

## Installation
The process of installation is the next:
 - Go to release folder and choose de latest version
 - Execute the next command
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
sudo sh intall.sh 
```
 - Check if the program is working with the next command

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
systemctl status emca 
```
## Compile from source
Dependencies for raspbian (buster)
 - libconfig++-dev
 - libmysqlcppconn-dev
 - wiringpi
 - i2c-tools
 - libi2c-dev
 - build-essential
 - git

Build command
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
make 
```
The destination folder is `build/bin`

Install
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
sudo make install 
```

Also support remote copy, first you need to configure the rapberry pi host in `/etc/hosts` as `rpi` and configure ssh keys
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
make remote_copy 
```

## Build with QEMU in amd64 for arm32v7
If you prefer compile from amd64 to arm32v7 you can use docker and QEMU
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```
Build command 
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workdir ivan28823/emcaworkspace
```

## Configuration file
The config file is saved in `/etc/emca/config.cfg`
